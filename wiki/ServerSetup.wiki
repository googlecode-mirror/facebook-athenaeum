= Server Setup =
Currently the Facebook Athenaeum codebase only works with PHP5 and uses the Smarty templating engine and PEAR DB library. While not required, the application also uses Apache's mod_rewrite to make "pretty" URLs. 

The web server setup is relatively easy. You simply download the latest snapshot and expand it to you desired location. 

{{{
cd /var/www/htdocs
wget 
tar zxvf facebook_athenaeum.tar.gz
}}}

The only other change you need to make is to point the [FacebookSetup Callback URL in the Facebook Application] to the URL for the space you just created.
