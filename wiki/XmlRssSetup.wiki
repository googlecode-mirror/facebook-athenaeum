= Introduction =

Adding the PEAR XML_RSS library to your PHP include directory is relatively easy with PEAR. If you're not using the {{{smarty_helper.sh}}} script, you can manually add this with the following:

{{{
$> pear upgrade pear
$> pear install --onlyreqdeps DB
$> pear install --onlyreqdeps XML_RSS
}}}

Ok, if you're paying attention, I also added the DB pear library in there, but you need it too :)
